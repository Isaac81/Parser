# Parser - Leviathan


### Idea
<p align="justify">This is a project created to practice with Java, developing two analyzers, one lexical and one syntactic.
The analyzers will read the syntax of a custom programming language called leviathan, whose files are going to have the .lev extension.
</p>


## Files

<p align="justify">In this moment, it works with static paths, so the input file is located at the following path: `src/resources/input/test2.lev`.
Once the lexical analyzer has finished its work, it saves the recognized `tokens` on a csv file called `output.csv` at path `src/resources/output`.</p>


## Note

The project is not yet finished, but it shows approximately 80% progress on lexical analyzer, and the bases of the syntactic analyzer.
